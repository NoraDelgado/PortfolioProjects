The Storm Chaser

In this project, I'll analyze a dataset of storms using Java. I'll apply programming concepts such as methods, loops, and file input, and build this program from an object-oriented programming perspective.

In this project, I will read structured data from a file, organize it into meaningful summaries, and encapsulate the information inside a class.


This program will: 

- Read storm data from a file (hurricane.data)

- Calculate storm categories using the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale

- Track key statistics like maximum wind speed and minimum pressure

- Filter and sort the data (category and wind speed)

- Display the formatted results showing the most powerful storms
